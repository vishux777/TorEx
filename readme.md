# SecureTor Bridge

A Chrome extension designed to provide **secure and straightforward** access to proxy networks directly within your Chrome browser. This extension offers enhanced privacy features and anonymous browsing capabilities without requiring separate software installations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This extension is for educational and privacy research purposes.** Users are responsible for complying with local laws and regulations. The extension provides proxy connectivity but does not guarantee complete anonymity. For maximum security, consider using dedicated privacy tools like the official Tor Browser.

## What is Anonymous Browsing?

Anonymous browsing allows you to surf the internet without revealing your real IP address or location. When you use proxy networks, your internet traffic is routed through remote servers around the world, making it very difficult for websites, advertisers, or other entities to track your online activities back to your physical location.

- **üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Mode**: Block WebRTC leaks, canvas fingerprinting, and browser tracking
- **üîÑ Automatic Circuit Refresh**: Periodically change your proxy connection for improved privacy
- **üìä Connection Monitoring**: Real-time connection status and IP verification
- **üéØ Fingerprint Protection**: Reduce browser fingerprinting and tracking attempts
- **‚ö° Smart Reconnection**: Automatically recovers from connection drops
- **üåê DNS Leak Protection**: Prevents DNS queries from revealing your real location
- **üì± User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI with connection status indicators

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

#### "Unable to establish secure connection"
- **Check internet connection**: Ensure you have stable internet access
- **Firewall interference**: Temporarily disable firewall/antivirus to test
- **Network restrictions**: Some networks block proxy connections
- **Try different times**: Server availability varies throughout the day

#### "Connection drops frequently"
- **Network instability**: Check your internet connection stability
- **VPN conflicts**: Disable other VPN/proxy software while using this extension
- **ISP throttling**: Some ISPs limit or block proxy traffic
- **Lower refresh interval**: Set circuit refresh to "Never" for more stability

#### "IP address unchanged" Warning
- **Proxy not working**: The proxy server may be experiencing issues
- **DNS leaks**: Your DNS queries might be bypassing the proxy
- **Try reconnecting**: Disconnect and reconnect to get a new server
- **Check settings**: Ensure security enforcement is enabled

### Performance Issues

#### "Slow browsing speeds"
- **Expected behavior**: Proxy connections are typically slower than direct connections
- **Server congestion**: Try connecting at different times of day
- **Distance factor**: Proxy servers may be geographically distant
- **Disable unnecessary features**: Turn off auto-refresh for better speeds

#### "Pages not loading"
- **Server overload**: The proxy server may be overloaded
- **Website blocking**: Some sites block proxy traffic
- **Try reconnecting**: Get a different proxy server by reconnecting
- **Disable ad blockers**: Other extensions might interfere

### Browser Issues

#### "Extension not responding"
- **Restart Chrome**: Close Chrome completely and restart
- **Clear extension data**: Go to chrome://extensions ‚Üí SecureTor Bridge ‚Üí Remove ‚Üí Reinstall
- **Update Chrome**: Ensure you're using a recent version of Chrome
- **Check permissions**: Verify the extension has all required permissions

#### "Settings not saving"
- **Storage permissions**: Ensure the extension has storage permissions
- **Incognito mode**: Settings may not persist in incognito windows
- **Corrupted data**: Try clearing extension data and reconfiguring

## Security Considerations & Limitations

### What This Extension Provides
‚úÖ **IP Address Anonymization**: Hides your real IP address from websites  
‚úÖ **Basic Traffic Routing**: Routes web traffic through proxy servers  
‚úÖ **WebRTC Leak Protection**: Prevents WebRTC from exposing your real IP  
‚úÖ **Fingerprinting Reduction**: Reduces browser-based tracking  
‚úÖ **DNS Leak Protection**: Routes DNS queries through proxy  

### What This Extension Does NOT Provide
‚ùå **Complete Anonymity**: Not equivalent to using dedicated privacy tools  
‚ùå **End-to-End Encryption**: HTTPS sites provide encryption, not the proxy itself  
‚ùå **Protection Against All Tracking**: Advanced tracking methods may still work  
‚ùå **Legal Protection**: Users must comply with local laws and regulations  
‚ùå **Malware Protection**: Does not scan for or block malicious content  

### Best Practices for Anonymous Browsing
- **Don't log into personal accounts** while connected
- **Avoid downloading files** that could be traced back to you
- **Use HTTPS websites** whenever possible for additional encryption
- **Don't share personal information** in any form
- **Be aware of time-zone leaks** - avoid mentioning your local time
- **Clear cookies and browsing data** regularly
- **Use different browsers** for anonymous and regular browsing

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Respect local laws**: Proxy usage may be restricted in some countries
- **Don't engage in illegal activities**: This tool is for privacy, not criminal activity
- **Respect website terms of service**: Some sites prohibit proxy usage
- **Consider impact on proxy providers**: Don't abuse free proxy services

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Proxy Discovery**: The extension connects to a network of proxy servers
2. **Connection Establishment**: Chrome's proxy API routes traffic through selected servers
3. **IP Verification**: Regular checks ensure your IP is properly masked
4. **Security Enforcement**: Content scripts block tracking and fingerprinting attempts
5. **Circuit Management**: Automatic rotation of proxy connections for enhanced privacy

### Supported Proxy Types
